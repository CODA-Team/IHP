# XSCHEM configuration 

The library and configuration file `xschemrc` can be found in the directory `libs.tech/xschem`. It configures 
the xschem editor to in order to include PDK root directory, library directories and simulation models. Since the configuration script uses 
`PDK_ROOT` environmental variable, it should be exported before running xschem.
```
export PDK_ROOT=your_path/IHP-Open-PDK/ihp-sg13g2
xschem &

## XSCHEM testcases

The top level schematic is `IHP_testcases.sch` cand be found at `libs.tech/xschem/sg13g2_tests` directory. 
By default each testcase exports the netlist to the `simulation` directory where `.spiceinit`file is uesd to configure NGSpice in HSPICE compatibiliy mode. Also a `psp103_nqs.osdi` file is 
by default placed in this directory in order to simulate the MOSFET devices using PSP103 model. This file can be regenerated and updated (if necessary) using method described [here](https://gitlab.com/dmt-development/ihp_sg13g2_compact_models) 
The `raw` files generated using simulations are placed in `raw/` folder. If a testcase exports CSV file it will be placed in `csv/` directory. The `scripts/` folder contains 
python scripts, which are used for CSV data postprocessing. All plots generated by the scripts are exported to the `fig/` directory. More information about testcases can be found
[here](sg13g2_tests/README.md)
