This folder contains MOS device measurement data in IC-CAP Data Manager (MDM) format.  
MOS devices supported: nmos (low and high voltage), pmos (low and high voltage)  
Directory contents:
* doc -> report files with comparison against Spectre simulations
* SG13_`<device>` -> measurement data
* test_structures -> different test segments layouts (GDSII) with the documentation

### Naming convention
```
W10u0_L0u5_S387_5
* W10u0 -> width 10um
* L0u5  -> length 0.5um
* S387  -> test segment S387
* 5     -> DUT â„–5
```
